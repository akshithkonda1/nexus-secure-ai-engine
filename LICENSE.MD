## Inspiration vs. Infringement

**"Inspiration"** means learning from architectural decisions and building your own implementation from scratch in your own words and structure.

**"Infringement"** means copying code, logic flows, or substantial patterns even with modifications.

**When in doubt**: If you're looking at Ryuzen code while writing your code, you're probably infringing.

## Why This License?

Ryuzen's epistemic honesty philosophy extends to our licensing: we're transparent about protecting our proprietary technology while encouraging learning and innovation. The code is visible so you can understand how epistemic honesty works in practice, but the implementation that powers it remains ours.

If you want to build something commercial inspired by Ryuzen's approach, build it yourself from first principles. If you want to use Ryuzen's actual code, let's talk licensing.
