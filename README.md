## <img src="assets/logo_nexus.png" alt="Nexus Logo" width="180px"><br>What is Nexus.ai?
Nexus.ai is a **vendor-neutral, cloud-native AI orchestration platform** designed to:
- Aggregate responses from **multiple AI models** (LLMs, proprietary, and open-source).
- Enrich results with **live, verifiable context** from trusted sources.
- **Validate, rank, and encrypt** outputs before delivery.

**In plain English:** Nexus is an **AI firewall** — ensuring every answer is **accurate, secure, and production-ready**.

---

## Why It’s Different
Unlike most AI systems that simply generate output, Nexus:
1. Forces **multi-model debate** to reduce bias and hallucinations.
2. Validates answers against **real-time, authoritative sources**.
3. Embeds **production-grade security** from the first line of code.
4. Operates in **safe demonstrator mode** with a direct path to live deployment.
5. Integrates seamlessly into **existing enterprise ecosystems** without lock-in.

---

## Why It Matters
Unchecked AI can:
- Hallucinate or fabricate facts.
- Miss critical real-time updates.
- Expose sensitive information.
- Introduce costly operational errors.

**Nexus mitigates these risks** by:
- Cross-verifying results across multiple models.
- Adding context from **live search and web intelligence**.
- Applying **AES-256 encryption** end-to-end.
- Scaling for **millions of secure, low-latency requests**.

---

## Core Features (With Impact)
- **Multi-Model AI Debate** — Truth-prioritized, bias-resistant outputs.  
- **Live Context Injection** — Always relevant, always current.  
- **Encryption by Default** — AES-256, KMS integration, TLS 1.3 enforcement.  
- **Intelligent Ranking** — Noise-filtering algorithms to surface the best answer.  
- **Multi-Cloud Ready** — Operates across AWS, Azure, and GCP.  
- **Safe Demonstrator Mode** — No secrets embedded, instant production capability.  
- **Compliance-Grade Logging** — Full audit trails with configurable TTL.

## <img src="assets/logo_infraops.png" alt="InfraOps Logo" width="180px"><br>InfraOps Companion (Coming Soon)
A **machine learning & LLM-powered operations manager** for real-time infrastructure observability and automated remediation.  
- Predictive anomaly detection  
- Automated incident resolution workflows  
- Multi-cloud operational dashboards  
- SIEM integration-ready for enterprise security

**Designed for mission-critical workloads**, InfraOps Companion continuously monitors distributed systems for anomalies, surfaces root causes, and executes automated resolutions — preventing downtime and reducing MTTR.

## <img src="assets/logo_loganalyzer.png" alt="LogAnalyzer.AI Logo" width="180px"><br>LogAnalyzer.AI (Coming Soon)
An **LLM-powered log intelligence platform** for AI and multi-cloud ecosystems.  
- **Natural Language Queries** — Search logs without learning query syntax.  
- **AI Hallucination & Drift Detection** — Identify abnormal model behaviors in real time.  
- **API Call Pattern Analysis** — Detect systemic issues before they scale.  
- **Root Cause AI Insights** — Accelerate MTTR and improve resilience.

**Engineered for scale**, LogAnalyzer.AI helps engineering, SRE, and security teams maintain **trust, uptime, and reliability** in AI-integrated environments.

## System at a Glance  
**Design Principles:** **Safety, Scalability, Security**  

**Infrastructure Highlights:**  
- **Security:** AES-256, RBAC, multi-cloud KMS, network segmentation, audit logging.  
- **Containerization:** Isolated microservices for each tool, orchestrated via Kubernetes or ECS/AKS/GKE.  
- **Storage Strategy:**  
  - **Hot:** Low-latency object storage, distributed NoSQL.  
  - **Warm:** Relational DBs for transactional workloads.  
  - **Cold:** Long-term archival in cost-optimized storage.  
- **Compute:** Auto-scaling containerized workloads and VM clusters across all major clouds.  
- **Observability:** Cloud-native metrics, automated backups, tiered storage rollovers.

---

## Security Model
- **No hardcoded secrets** — uses `.env` or cloud secrets managers.  
- **Data encryption** — at rest and in transit.  
- **Granular API scopes** — least-privilege integrations.  
- **Attack surface reduction** — DoS mitigation, HTTPS-only endpoints.  
- **Controlled log retention** — compliance-aligned TTL.

---

## Author & Ownership
**Designed, architected, and implemented end-to-end by a single engineer**, showcasing the ability to:
- Deliver **multi-cloud, production-grade AI platforms**.  
- Integrate **security-first principles** into every layer.  
- Build modular systems for **scalable enterprise adoption**.

## Getting Started
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/akshiththeindian/nexus-secure-ai-engine.git
cd nexus-secure-ai-engine


Choose the module you want to start:
# Core engine
cd nexus

# Infrastructure observability
cd infra-ops

# Log intelligence platform
cd log-analyzer

# 2. Install dependencies for the program you want to run:
Each Program has its own requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
#Add your API keys, secrets, or leave blank to run in demonstrator mode.
For production, integrate with cloud secrets managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager).

# 4. Run the app
 Run the FlaskApp that Corresponds with the program you desire:
# Example: running Nexus engine
python Nexus_FlaskApp.py

## Multi-Cloud Deployment Quickstart

Nexus modules are deployable to any major cloud using Terraform for infrastructure and Kubernetes for orchestration. Below are minimal, production-oriented examples that you can adapt to your environment.

### Prerequisites
- Terraform ≥ 1.5 installed
- kubectl ≥ 1.27 installed
- Docker or compatible OCI builder
- Cloud CLI configured (one or more): `aws` / `az` / `gcloud`
- A container registry (ECR/ACR/GCR/Artifact Registry) and a repository created

---

### 1) Containerize the Module (any module: `nexus`, `infra-ops`, or `log-analyzer`)
```bash
# From the module directory (e.g., ./nexus)
docker build -t <REGISTRY>/<PROJECT>/nexus:<TAG> .
docker push <REGISTRY>/<PROJECT>/nexus:<TAG>
