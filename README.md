## <img src="assets/logo_nexus.png" alt="Nexus Logo" width="180px"><br>What is Nexus.ai?
Nexus.ai is a **cloud-native AI orchestration platform** that:
- Gathers responses from **multiple AI models** (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.).
- Is **Cloud Vendor Neutral** — AWS, Azure, GCP all supported.
- Enriches them with **real-time search results** from trusted sources.
- **Validates, ranks, and encrypts** before delivering to the user.

**In plain English:** Nexus is your **AI safety layer** — making answers **more accurate, secure, and trustworthy**.

---

##  Why It Matters
Without validation, AI can and will eventually:
- Hallucinate facts.
- Miss critical updates.
- Leak sensitive information.
- Make critical errors that no one wants.

**Nexus fixes that** by:
- Cross-checking results across **multiple AI engines**, allowing them to debate cohesively and formulate together what the answer is to a particular problem.
- Adding **live web context** via scraping and search.
- Encrypting everything **end-to-end** with AES-256.
- Scaling to handle **millions of secure requests**.

---

## Core Features (With Impact)
- **Multi-Model AI Debate** — Balanced, bias-resistant answers.  
- **Live Web Context** — Relevant and up-to-date information.  
- **Encrypted by Default** — AES-256 protection prevents leaks.  
- **Smart Ranking Algorithms** — Filters noise, prioritizes truth.  
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** — Seamless AWS scalability.  
- **Safe Demonstrator Mode** — No live API keys required.  
- **Full Audit Trails** — Compliance-ready logging with TTL retention.

## System at a Glance

**Design Principles:** Safety • Scalability • Security

**Infrastructure Highlights:**
- **Security:** AES-256, IAM, AWS KMS, VPC isolation, CloudTrail monitoring.
- **Containerized Design:** Each tool operates independently or integrated.  
- **Storage:**  
  - Hot: S3 for logs/backups, DynamoDB for instant lookups.  
  - Warm: RDS & Aurora for structured data.  
  - Cold: Glacier for archival.  
- **Compute:** EC2 + ECS/Fargate for horizontal scaling.
- **Observability:** CloudWatch, automated snapshots, tiered storage rollover.

---

## Security Model
- **No hardcoded secrets** — `.env` or AWS Secrets Manager only.
- **Encrypted requests** — at rest and in transit.
- **API key scopes** — granular permissions per integration.
- **Attack resistance** — DoS protection, HTTPS enforcement.
- **Controlled logging** — Retained only as necessary.
