Interpretation:
- Contradictions within thresholds are normal for epistemic engines and incur no penalty until they exceed rigor bounds.
- Opus escalation is treated as judicial deep reasoning; it is neutral unless rates surpass the defined thresholds.
- Determinism outranks unanimity; consistent, repeatable outputs matter more than perfectly aligned responses.
- A+ represents production-grade readiness with deterministic, bounded variance and headroom under load.
This system favors correctness, validation, and safety over shallow speed.
Contradictions and escalations reflect epistemic honesty, not instability.
100% determinism confirms reproducibility.
Workspace readiness:
- Toron stability confirmed for UI-driven usage.
- Deterministic outputs ensure UI consistency.
- Latency within consumer tolerances.
- Escalation behavior predictable.
