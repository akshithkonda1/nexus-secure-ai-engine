Interpretation:
- Contradictions within bounded rates reflect healthy epistemic debate and are benign until they exceed operational limits.
- Opus escalation is encouraged on harder problems and indicates productive deep reasoning rather than instability when within thresholds.
- Determinism outranks unanimity; consistent, repeatable outputs matter more than perfectly aligned responses.
- A+ represents production-grade readiness with deterministic, bounded variance and headroom under load.
This engine demonstrates production-grade epistemic stability.
